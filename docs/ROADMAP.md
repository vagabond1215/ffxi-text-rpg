## Latest bounded unit

### Wetland / Island Distribution Repair

**Status: IMPLEMENTED ON `main`; promoted as Data 61 / Product 0.9.100.22.**

This is a pure existing-species distribution pass:
- East Starfen gains Mirecrest Heron, Reed Eel, Reed Crab, and Glasswing Dragonfly populations;
- Reedcrown Isle gains Silver Perch, Glasswing Dragonfly, and Fen Duck populations;
- Starfen Lower Delta gains Saltflat Mud Crab presence;
- Reedcrown Crown Grebe now has same-place Lake Perch prey-family overlap.

No new species, family, gathering source, raw resource, process, output, route, place, settlement, service, or durable state family was added. Wetland/island/delta vegetation descriptions were strengthened without inventory-node inflation.

Implementation freeze `48948292ea26a38d91d306d12998973c1ae35677` passed Check #1626 / run `33325861973` with **817/817 tests**, Repository Audit, Census, Benchmark 3, and Benchmark Sample. Promoted runtime/data SHA: `d861b1a6cdeca5a470fb13fa429a7329353b6b02`.

Game State remains 14.

Mechanics-scale gate remains **NOT READY**.

## Latest planning pass

### Macro-World Topology Lock

**Status: COMPLETE ON `main`; documentation/planning only.**

No Product, Data, Game State, or Benchmark change accompanies this pass. The latest runtime/data checkpoint is Data 60.

## Formal Phase 0.9 sequence

Packets A–D: **COMPLETE / MERGED**.

### Packet E — Gate A integration/census audit

**QUEUED / NOT STARTED.**

Packet E remains the next formal roadmap gate unless a future explicit work order chooses another bounded content/system tranche first.

Packet E should inspect:
- which remaining count gaps correspond to missing player loops versus simple breadth;
- pack dependency/ownership density;
- route/service reachability;
- item source/sink depth;
- NPC/quest/companion network gaps;
- production and ability breadth;
- architecture debt exposed by the larger world.

## Macro-world topology

**TOPOLOGY LOCK COMPLETE / NO VERSION CHANGE.**

Permanent authority:
- `docs/WORLD_MACRO_TOPOLOGY.md`.

The lock establishes:

- irregular continuous world geography rather than a global square/hex board;
- route graph as inter-place traversability/distance/time authority;
- local grids/topologies as place-scale exploration abstractions;
- Central Continent + Southern Landmass + Eastern Archipelago;
- Deep World + Pelagic layers;
- Ironspine and western mountain-crescent barriers;
- Great Mere east-draining freshwater outflow to a future brackish delta/Eastern Sea;
- reserved Lethari, Korren, Miri, Veyra, Waymeet, and pelagic civilization envelopes.

The old macro-planning hold is lifted as a geography blocker. Edge implementation still requires an explicit bounded work order.

Post-lock world-edge status:

- **Headwater Vale — COMPLETE / Data 52.**
- **Starfen Delta / Brackish Coast — COMPLETE / Data 53.**
- **Gloamwood & Oldbough Refuge — COMPLETE / Data 54.**
- **Emberwash Badlands & Cinderwell Station — COMPLETE / Data 55.**
- **Lower Deepvein & Lantern Sump Station — COMPLETE / Data 56.**
- **Waymeet Marches & Cairnward Relay — COMPLETE / Data 57.**

Remaining ranking:
1. Waymeet Inner Marches / outer crossroads approach;
2. Coppergrass extensions;
3. Drowned Vaults.

The temporary detailed edge notes remain in `docs/TEMP_WORLD_EDGE_EXTENSION_PLAN.md`.

### Central Continent completion budget

Planning intent established at Data 55 and updated after the Data 57 surface pass:

- current surface-region maturity is approximately **60–70%** at the present authored granularity;
- budget approximately **9–13 additional substantial surface-region passes** for a broadly complete Central Continent;
- roughly **5–7** of those are enough to finish the minimum coherent continental skeleton; the remainder should add warranted route, ecology, economy, settlement, and civilization-approach density;
- **Lower Deepvein and Drowned Vaults are not counted in the surface percentage** because they are vertical/subterranean expansions;
- avoid subdividing wilderness for its own sake; after the Central Continent reaches a coherent skeleton, prefer outward expansion toward Veyra, Miri, Korren, and Pelagic realms.

The detailed corridor budget and completion doctrine live in `docs/WORLD_MACRO_TOPOLOGY.md`.

## High-value system/content gaps

- companion breadth;
- production/recipe breadth already exceeds the mechanics floor; future recipes should deepen utility rather than chase count;
- NPC and quest network density;
- ability/technique breadth;
- deeper Crownfields agricultural processing/husbandry when justified;
- Cross-biome Family Breadth is the next ranked ecology-quality packet after the Data 61 Wetland / Island distribution repair.

## Durable constraints

- one domain authority per state family;
- one fictional world clock;
- maps/places/routes must cross-reference cleanly;
- no contradictory direct edges shadowing canonical routes;
- player-enterable places require an escape path unless deliberate;
- Pack v2 owns placement/dependencies, not duplicate definitions;
- universal magic remains shared/character-owned;
- managed animal products should wait for a real husbandry source model;
- new zone food-capable raws require explicit consumption safety plus plausible processing paths, with world-facing language grounded in practical fantasy-era knowledge;
- Game State changes only for new durable serialized state.

## Validation contract

```bash
npm run audit:repo
npm test
npm run census
npm run benchmark
npm run benchmark:sample
```
